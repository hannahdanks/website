## Work Experience

I have worked as a kennel technician for over 350 hours at the Legacy Veterinary Hospital in Frisco, Texas, practicing skills such as medicating, hygiene techniques, and nail trims. I have worked as a techniciansâ€™ assistant since April of 2019 for Crestview Veterinary Clinic in Austin, Texas where I have gained experiences such as blood draws and other teching duties. I was also a teaching assistant in the Fall of 2019 for a Neuroscience class, From the Eye to the Brain. 

## Research Experience

In the summer of 2018, I worked as a research assistant at the University of Sydney, in the veterinary school. I conducted research in Parasitology on toxoplasma. 

In addition, I conducted field research at the Tiputini Biodiversity Station in the summer of 2019. I researched the visual systems and behaviors of various species of primates in the Ecuadorian Amazon.
