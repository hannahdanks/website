###Teen Pregnancy This dataset shows rates of teenage girls pregnant per 1000 teenage girls in each state. It also has variables for Civil War role (i.e. whether that state was a border, confederate, union, or other) and for percent of people who attened church in the previous week from that state. This dataset had interesting variables that I thought would compare well to an election.</description>
