## About Me

Canadian born, I was raised North of Dallas in Frisco, Texas. Having found a passion for taking care of animals early on, I have been driven throughout my education by the motivation to attend veterinary school and become a wildlife rescue veterinarian. I am currently in the application and interview process and am very excited for what's in store!

## Interests

In my free time, I enjoying all things nature. From hiking and biking to camping, I love being outside. In addition, I enjoy running half marathons and triathlons.
