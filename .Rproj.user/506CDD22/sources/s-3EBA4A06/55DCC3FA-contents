## Work Experience

I have worked as a kennel technician for over 350 hours at the Legacy Veterinary Hospital in Frisco, Texas, practicing skills such as medicating, expressing anal glands, and nail trims. I have worked as a techniciansâ€™ assistant since April of 2019 for Crestview Veterinary Clinic in Austin, Texas.
